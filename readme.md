This is a library for writting Python applications that make use of Dataverse Network (DVN) APIs.

The code was originally written as a "proof of concept" at https://github.com/dvn/swordpoc/tree/master/dvn_client but the intention is to eventually publish the code on https://pypi.python.org

For now https://github.com/dvn/swordpoc/blob/master/dvn_client/README.md has some tips but they should be incorporated into this repo.
